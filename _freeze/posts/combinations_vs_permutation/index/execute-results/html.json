I did not want to contact the store if I could avoid that.\n\nFor example,\n\n`A3E# - 3JH# - 45HL`\n\nwhere the hashtags are the two values I can not see clearly. There are `36` possible values for each (`26` letters and `10` numbers), so figuring this out via bruteforce will take a long time. But how many possible numbers could it be?\n\nWhere\n\n\n$$\n\\text{ Characters to choose from} = n\n$$\n\n$$\nn = 36\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{ Characters selected} = k\n$$\n\n$$\nk = 2\n$$\n\n\n## Combinations\n\nPretending that order does not matter for our code or password, we could calculate the combinations by\n\n\n$$\nC_{k}^{\\prime}(n) = \\binom{n + k  - 1}{k}\n$$\n\n$$\nC_{2}^{\\prime}(36) = C_{2}(36 +2 - 1)\n$$\n\n$$\nC_{2}(37) = \\binom{37}{2} = \\frac{37!}{2!(37 - 2)!} = \\frac{37 \\cdot 36}{2 \\cdot 1} = 666\n$$\n\n\nIf order did not matter and we could not have repetition then we would have\n\n\n$$\nC_{k}(n) = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n$$\n\n$$\nC_{2}(36) = \\binom{36}{2} = \\frac{36!}{2!(36 - 2)!} = \\frac{36 \\cdot 35}{2 \\cdot 1} = 630\n$$\n\n\n## Permutation\n\nThis problem will be a permutation problem since the order is important since `A` and `5` is not the same as `5` and `A` due to both values being independent from each other. For example,\n\n`A3EA - 3JH5 - 45HL` $!=$ `A3E5 - 3JHA - 45HL`\n\nThis is a simple solution since **repetition is allowed**. For example, both values could be the same. As such\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Permutation} = P\n$$\n\n$$\nP_{k}^{\\prime} = n^{k}\n$$\n\n$$\nP_{2}^{\\prime} = 36^{2} = 1296\n$$\n\n\nHowever, lets just say in this situation **repetition is not allowed**. This would mean if the first character is `A` then the second character cannot be `A`. While this may seem like an obscure example in this example, imagine if the code was not entirely scratched off and you were certain that the two values were different from each other.\n\n\n$$\nP_{k}(n) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)}!\n$$\n\n$$\nP_{2}(36) = \\frac{36!}{(36-2)} = \\frac{36!}{34!} = 36 \\cdot 35 = 1260\n$$\n\n\nThis should be fairly intuitive since `1296 - 1260 = 36`.\n\n## Passwords\n\nTo finish here are the amount of unique combinations for a password of `6 characters`\n\n| Characters Used                        | Possible Characters | Unique Permutations |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| `a - z`                                | 26                  | 308,915,776         |\n| `a - z & 0 - 9`                        | 36                  | 2,176,782,336       |\n| `a - z & A - Z`                        | 52                  | 19,770,609,664      |\n| `a - z & A - Z & 0 - 9`                | 62                  | 56,800,235,584      |\n| `a - z & A - Z & 0 - 9 & !@#$%^&*()+-` | 74                  | 164,206,490,176     |\n\nand `8 characters`\n\n| Characters Used                        | Possible Characters | Unique Permutations |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| `a - z`                                | 26                  | 208,827,064,576     |\n| `a - z & 0 - 9`                        | 36                  | 2,821,109,907,456   |\n| `a - z & A - Z`                        | 52                  | 53,459,728,531,456  |\n| `a - z & A - Z & 0 - 9`                | 62                  | 218,340,105,584,896 |\n| `a - z & A - Z & 0 - 9 & !@#$%^&*()+-` | 74                  | 899,194,740,203,776 |\n\nIf you want to calculate these values in `R` you can simply do it via\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.6     ✔ purrr   0.3.4\n✔ tibble  3.1.7     ✔ dplyr   1.0.9\n✔ tidyr   1.2.0     ✔ stringr 1.4.0\n✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.1\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrossing(\n  # total characters \n  character_n = c(26, 36, 52, 62, 74),\n  # password length\n  length = c(6, 7, 8, 10, 12), \n  possible_values = character_n ^ length\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 125 × 3\n   character_n length possible_values\n         <dbl>  <dbl>           <dbl>\n 1          26      6         3.09e 8\n 2          26      6         7.84e10\n 3          26      6         5.35e13\n 4          26      6         8.39e17\n 5          26      6         2.70e22\n 6          26      7         3.09e 8\n 7          26      7         7.84e10\n 8          26      7         5.35e13\n 9          26      7         8.39e17\n10          26      7         2.70e22\n# … with 115 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
